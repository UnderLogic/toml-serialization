# Attributes

## Overview

Attributes are used to customize the serialization and deserialization behavior of a class, struct, or field.

They provide ways to customize the field name, field ordering, and field selection.

In addition to the attributes provided by the library, several built-in attributes are also supported.
For example, the `NonSerializedAttribute` can be used to exclude a field from serialization.

See each individual attribute for more information.
