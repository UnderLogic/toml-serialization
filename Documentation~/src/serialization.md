# Serialization

## Overview

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a TOML document.
Deserialization is the process of converting a TOML document back into an object representation.

The [TomlSerializer](serialization/toml-serializer.md) class provides static methods for serializing objects to and from TOML format.

Please note the [Limitations](limitations.md) of the serialization process.
