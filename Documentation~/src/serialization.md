# Serialization

## Overview

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a TOML document and writing the output representation to a string, stream, or text writer.

The [TomlSerializer](serialization/toml-serializer.md) class provides static methods for serializing objects to TOML format.

Please note the [Limitations](serialization-rules/limitations.md) of the serialization process.
