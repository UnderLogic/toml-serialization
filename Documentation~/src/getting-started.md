# Getting Started

## Context

[TOML](https://toml.io/en/) is a data format similar to JSON, but looks like an INI file.
It is designed to be easy to read and write by humans, and is a good alternative to JSON for configuration files.

It also maps well to hash tables and dictionaries, which makes it a good choice for serializing data.

## Use Cases

### Configuration Files

Where you need to serialize and deserialize configuration data.
This could be player preferences, game settings, or any other data that needs to be saved and loaded.

### Save Files

Where you need to serialize and deserialize save game data.
This could be player progress, game state, or any other data that needs to be saved and loaded.

### Level Data

Where you need to serialize and deserialize level data.
This could be level settings, variations, or any other data that needs to be saved and loaded.

### Human Readable & Editable

TOML is designed to be easy to read and write by humans.
This makes it easy to edit and maintain configuration files, save files, and level data by hand.
It allows quick prototyping and iteration of data, and is a good choice for game jams.

## Samples

The `Samples~` folder contains sample scenes showcasing various aspects of the library in action.
It is recommended to import and play around with them in Unity to get a feel for how to use the library.
