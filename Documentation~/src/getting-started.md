# Getting Started

## Context

[TOML](https://toml.io/en/) is a data format similar to JSON, but looks like an INI file.
It is designed to be easy to read and write by humans, and is a good alternative to JSON for configuration files.

It also maps well to hash tables and dictionaries, which makes it a good choice for serializing data.

## Samples

The `Samples~` folder contains sample scenes showcasing various aspects of the library in action.
It is recommended to import and play around with them in Unity to get a feel for how to use the library.
