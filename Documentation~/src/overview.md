# Overview

Unity package library for serializing and deserializing [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) data.

Designed to be a cross between Unity's `JsonUtility` and Microsoft's `System.Text.Json` libraries.

This library is not intended to support the full TOML 1.0 specification.
It is designed to support the most common use cases for serializing and deserializing data.
