# Overview

Unity package library for serializing and deserializing [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) data.

## What is TOML?

TOML is a relatively newer data format that is gaining popularity.

It is a superset of [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) formats, and is designed to be easy to read and write by humans.
It is also designed to be easy to parse by machines.

## Motivation

Unity does not have built-in support for TOML files and many existing libraries are not compatible with Unity.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could serialize and deserialize TOML data in Unity, similar to the built-in `JsonUtility`?

This library is designed to be a cross between Unity's `JsonUtility` and Microsoft's `System.Text.Json` libraries in terms of functionality and ease of use.

## Limitations

This library is **not** intended to support the full TOML 1.0 specification.
It is designed to support the most common use cases for serializing and deserializing data.

While it does aim to support all of the TOML data types, including nested tables, it does not support all of the TOML syntax.
This means that TOML files generated by other libraries with more complex notation _may_ not be compatible with this library.

However, any TOML file generated by this library _should_ be compatible with other TOML libraries (and itself).
